        <p class="sentence">MANILA – The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Friday vowed to explore further measures to increase the agency’s conviction rate against drug personalities.“To be frank, what I really want is a 100 percent conviction rate for all drug cases filed, but this only happens  in a perfect world, so I will settle for the high conviction rates which we have at present. Of course, I am pleased with the numbers that we have been tallying, we have made leaps and bounds throughout the years with regards to legislation that aim to improve our capability to prosecute organized drug trafficking rings,” PDEA Director General Wilkins Villanueva said in a statement, citing statistics of drug cases filed in court.</p>
